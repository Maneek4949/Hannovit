                    </div>
                    <p class="mb-4">We start by listening to clients' issues, requirements, challenges and objectives. Then we do market analysis, understand the business of the client and their existing processes and solution. After analyzing the solution technically, we provide client with mockup User Experience Screens. In this way client will have the very good understanding of their product before it is developed in real. We also provide detail of technology, timeline and cost. After we start the development process, our team of tester do thorough testing of project from the beginning. We also deploy the project on cloud from week one so that client can view the live progress of project, hence avoiding any delay or misunderstanding in requirement on later stage.</p>
